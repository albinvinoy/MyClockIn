Some basic Git commands:

=====This is to push the changes=====

Make a folder for the use of the project
	git clone -url- : type in the url of the git repository
Make whatever changes you want to change in that folder such as code and whatever
	get status -folder address-: This will tell you what the file status to see if your
									saves are recorded and whatnot
	git add -A : This will automatically add all the files that are to be saved
	git commit -m "write your message": You need to write some message else it will not
											agree to commit
	git push

===This is to pull from the repository=====
Locate your folder
	git clone -url- : type in the url of the git repository
	git pull
	
Thats pretty much all we need for now. There are like more funtions tho.
